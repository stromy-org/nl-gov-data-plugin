name: format-mermaid
description: "Creates Mermaid diagrams for Markdown-based documentation (GitHub, GitLab, wikis, blogs) and visual explanations. Supports 25+ diagram types including flowcharts, sequence/class/state diagrams, ERDs, Gantt charts, mindmaps, timelines, architecture views, Kanban boards, Sankey diagrams, and newer types (Wardley maps, Venn, Ishikawa). When the `mermaid` MCP is available, uses live browser preview and PNG/SVG/PDF export. Use this skill when users ask for Mermaid syntax, Markdown-renderable diagrams, visual architecture, or quick text-to-diagram output."
client_summary: "Sketch a quick diagram for documentation or a wiki, written as text rather than drawn by hand."

# Mermaid Diagrams (MCP-hosted skill)

This skill's full instructions are hosted on the `stromy-format` MCP server. Do not hardcode workflow logic locally — always fetch the live version from the MCP.

## Loading instructions

1. Read the main skill instructions:
   → call the `fs_read` tool on the `stromy-format` MCP with `path="skills/format-mermaid/SKILL.md"`.

   **Read it to the end.** `fs_read` returns one page at a time. If the result's `next_offset_chars` is not null — or the returned text ends in a `<<< PARTIAL READ … >>>` block — the body is incomplete: call `fs_read` again with `offset_chars` set to that value and concatenate, repeating until it comes back null. Do **not** start work on a partial skill body. Hard rules and anti-patterns often sit in the final third, and a partial read fails silently — it looks like a complete skill.

2. Discover reference files (and any other skill assets), then read on demand:
   → call `fs_list` with `path="skills/format-mermaid"` (and `path="skills/format-mermaid/references"`),
   → call `fs_read` with `path="skills/format-mermaid/references/<file>"`.

Follow the instructions returned by the MCP exactly.

## This MCP is the only correct path

Produce this skill's output **only** by following the live SKILL.md fetched above and calling the `stromy-format` MCP's own tools. Do **not** substitute a local or identically-named base skill from elsewhere, and do **not** invent your own output path. A locally-produced or unbranded artifact is **wrong output, not a fallback** — it bypasses the server-side brand and quality gates.
