# Dutch Government Data

## Overview

This skill is the orchestration layer over the `nl-gov-data` MCP. The MCP provides both a metadata surface and a content layer; this skill turns that surface into workflow-ready public-affairs outputs. The hosted remote FastMCP server (`nl-gov-data` as configured in `.mcp.json`) is the only runtime — no local stdio fallback is available in this plugin.

**The MCP now supports full content retrieval.** After metadata discovery, you can fetch and quote the actual text of:
- Kamerstukken (motions, bills, letters, memorie van toelichting)
- Aanhangsel van de Handelingen (kamervragen and answers)
- Handelingen (debate transcripts)
- Consolidated legislation text (BWB)
- Ministerial commitments (Toezeggingen)
- Debate transcripts with speaker attribution (VLOS)
- Rijksoverheid policy documents
- Attachments and beslisnota's (including PDF-only)

**Metadata titles are not evidence. Only quote from content tools.**

Use this skill when the user needs one of these outcomes:

- **Topic monitor**: what is happening on a Dutch policy topic across parliament and government narrative
- **Dossier tracker**: what happened in a specific dossier, in chronological order
- **Actor brief**: who a Dutch parliamentary actor is and what recent parliamentary activity surrounds them
- **Committee watch**: upcoming or recent activity for a specific committee
- **Legislative scan**: broad procedural scan of new legislation and votes
- **Ministry narrative**: what the government is saying on a topic versus parliamentary activity
- **Parliamentary landscape**: snapshot of current faction composition, seat counts, and political structure
- **Legislation lookup**: find a Dutch law by title/identifier, retrieve current version metadata, link to dossier if available
- **Legislative calendar watch**: monitor upcoming legislation by type, ministry, or topic
- **Law-to-dossier brief**: given a dossier number or BWB identifier, produce a brief combining enacted law + pipeline status + parliamentary publications
- **Organization lookup**: resolve Dutch government organization names to canonical TOOI URIs
- **Exploratory test**: systematic MCP coverage test across all tools

The skill keeps the MCP as the canonical data layer. It does not invent cross-source links that the MCP does not support. Where linkage is uncertain, state that clearly in `metadata`.

## MCP runtime

Use the `nl-gov-data` MCP as configured in `.mcp.json` (hosted FastMCP endpoint). If the remote endpoint returns `401 Unauthorized`, treat that as an authentication/configuration issue and report it clearly. There is no local stdio fallback in this plugin — do not attempt to run a local server.

## Data exposure inventory

All exposed data should be treated as public/open government data, but chaining sources can create strategically sensitive public-affairs intelligence. Keep provenance and uncertainty visible.

| Surface | Exposed data | Strategic use |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Tweede Kamer members | `get_member`, `tk_search(Persoon)` expose names, active/former status, faction fields when available, role metadata, and source profile metadata. | Actor resolution, former/current status checks, activity anchoring. |
| Faction votes | `search_votes`, `tk_search(Stemming)` expose faction-level decisions, seats, related documents, dossiers, and nested vote metadata. | Coalition/opposition mapping, dossier support analysis, vote-context proxies. |
| Committee activity | `list_committees`, `search_activities`, `tk_search(Activiteit)` expose committee names/abbreviations, schedules, statuses, subjects, actors, and linked organizations. | Committee watch, hearing/debate timing, procedural signal tracking. |
| BWB/WGK legal pipeline | `bwb_search`, `bwb_get`, `wetgevingskalender_search`, `wetgevingskalender_get`, `search_legislation`, `get_legislative_brief` expose enacted-law versions, identifiers, validity dates, legal areas, pipeline phase, ministry, and entry-into-force metadata. | Law status checks, pipeline monitoring, dossier-to-law linkage. |
| ROO organization registry | `roo_list_organizations`, `roo_get_organization` expose canonical TOOI URIs, organization labels/types, and detail identifiers where available. | Ministry/organization normalization across Rijksoverheid, WGK, BWB, and publications. |

## Recommended research chains

These are soft preferences for efficient research, not hard rules:

- Prefer `get_dossier_timeline` + `koop_search(w.dossiernummer==...)` + `get_legislative_brief(dossier_number=...)` when chronology and official publications matter most.
- Consider `list_factions` + `list_committees` + `search_votes` for parliamentary context.
- Use `get_member` + `search_activities(actor=...)` + `search_votes(faction=...)` for actor briefs, but prefer caution for former MPs.
- Prefer `roo_list_organizations` + `roo_get_organization` when normalizing ministries.
- **Use `document_deep_read` after discovery** when the user wants actual text — not just metadata.

| Chain | Tools | Best for |
|-------|-------|----------|
| dossier | `get_dossier_timeline` + `koop_search` + `get_legislative_brief` | Procedural chronology, official publications, enacted-law status. |
| topic | `search_documents` + `search_activities` + `search_legislation` | Policy monitoring across parliament, government narrative, and law pipeline. |
| actor | `get_member` + `search_activities` + faction-level `search_votes` | MP/actor briefs with activity and faction proxy vote context. |
| ministry | `roo_list_organizations` + `rijksoverheid_search` + `wetgevingskalender_search` | Responsible-organization normalization and ministry narrative/pipeline scans. |
| vote_check | `tk_search(Stemming)` with expand chain + `tk_get` | Isolating the vote outcome for a specific motion within a large dossier. |
| **content_deep_read** | `resolve_identifier` → `document_deep_read` | Reading and quoting actual document text after metadata discovery. |
| **motion_brief** | `document_deep_read` + `tk_search(Stemming)` + `fetch_toezeggingen` + reference follow-up | Motion text, outcome, commitments, and government follow-up. |
| **law_text** | `bwb_search` → `fetch_bwb_text(article=...)` | Enacted law article and consolidated legal text. |
| **debate_transcript** | `search_activities`/`tk_search(Verslag)` → `fetch_tk_transcript` | Who said what in plenary/committee context. |
| **attachment_read** | `extract_document_references` → `fetch_attachment` | Beslisnota's, reports, appendices, and PDF-only evidence. |
| **large_doc_targeted** | `document_deep_read(toc_only=True)` → pick headings → `document_deep_read(section=...)` | Targeted reading of large documents (MvT, wetsvoorstellen, full Handelingen). |

### vote_check chain — isolating a single motion's vote

`search_votes` filters by dossier, date, and faction, but not by motion content. For large dossiers (e.g., 29435 Nota Ruimte: 646+ vote records), this makes it impossible to isolate one motion's outcome without scanning all records.

**Solution**: Use `tk_search` on entity `Stemming` with a deep expand chain and subject filter:

```
tk_search(
  entity="Stemming",
  expand=["Besluit($expand=Zaak($expand=Kamerstukdossier))"],
  filter="contains(Besluit/Zaak/Onderwerp, '<zoekterm>')",
  top=50
)
```

This returns only the per-faction vote records for motions whose `Onderwerp` contains the search term. Key fields in the response:

- `Besluit/BesluitSoort`: directly gives `"Stemmen - aangenomen"` or `"Stemmen - verworpen"`
- `FractieGrootte`, `ActorFractie`: faction name and size at time of vote
- `Soort`: `"Voor"` or `"Tegen"` per faction record
- `Besluit/Zaak/Onderwerp`: the motion subject line for verification

**When to use**: Whenever the user asks about the outcome of a specific motion, amendment, or vote within a dossier — especially when the dossier is large or contains many sub-items. Prefer this over `search_votes(dossier_number=...)` when you need to isolate a single item.

**Combine with**: `koop_search(query='w.dossiernummer==<nr> AND w.dossierondernummer==<sub>')` to resolve the official publication metadata for the same motion.

For discovery, prefer this skill, the MCP README, MCP resources, and MCP introspection over external `tool_search`, which may not enumerate this MCP reliably.

## Core principles

- Keep outputs structured. Default to JSON-shaped summaries with stable keys.
- Preserve provenance. Always keep `source`, MCP tool names, and warnings visible.
- Prefer deterministic links. Dossier timelines use `get_dossier_timeline`; do not force Rijksoverheid content into the timeline.
- Fail open. If one MCP call partially fails, still return usable output with `metadata.warnings`.
- Separate retrieval from interpretation. The workflow output may include a short synthesis, but the retrieved records remain primary.
- Treat tool errors as findings. Record them and continue with the next bounded call instead of abandoning the whole exploration.

### Content deep-read: when to fetch actual text

The MCP now exposes content tools. Use them whenever the user wants to read, quote, or reason about specific document content — not just discover what documents exist.

**When to use content tools:**

| User says | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| "what does it say", "quote", "summarize this document" | `document_deep_read` |
| "what are the key provisions of article N" | `fetch_bwb_text(article=N)` |
| "what did MP X say in debate Y" | `fetch_tk_transcript` |
| "what did the minister commit to" | `fetch_toezeggingen` |
| "what attachments/beslisnota's are there" | `extract_document_references` → `fetch_attachment` |

**Default content chain:**
1. `resolve_identifier(user_input)` — normalize to canonical identifier
2. `document_deep_read(resolved_identifier)` — fetch best available format
3. If needed: `extract_document_references(identifier)` → `document_deep_read(attachment)`

**Content tool cautions:**
- Only quote from `content.text_chunk` in the tool result — never from metadata titles
- **TRUNCATION RULE**: After every content fetch, check `pagination.truncated`.
  - If `truncated=false`: full document was returned — proceed.
  - If `truncated=true`: **stop and fetch the rest before synthesizing**. Use `document_deep_read(complete=True)` for automatic full retrieval (up to 200k chars), or manually paginate with `offset=next_offset`. `total_chars` tells you the full size.
  - **Never summarize, quote conclusions, or answer "what does it say" from a truncated result.** Doing so silently omits content the user cannot see. If the document is genuinely too large (>200k chars), say so explicitly and offer section targeting.
- If `pdf_quality` is `ocr_needed` or `empty`, state that the PDF text was unreliable
- blg-* attachments are frequently PDF-only; use `fetch_attachment("blg-...")` which handles the XML→PDF fallback
- TekstToezegging does not exist as an OData field — the actual field is `Tekst`

### Large document strategy

Dutch government documents vary enormously in size. Use the right approach for each tier:

| Document size | Strategy |
|--------------|----------|
| <50k chars (moties, kamervragen, brieven, single articles) | `document_deep_read` — returns complete in one call by default |
| 50k–200k chars (MvT, longer wetsvoorstellen, policy brieven) | `document_deep_read(complete=True)` — auto-paginates to full doc |
| >200k chars (full Handelingen sessions, large codifications) | TOC-first + section targeting, or sub-agent delegation |

**TOC-first pattern for large documents:**

```
1. document_deep_read(identifier, toc_only=True)
   → returns list of section headings with levels
2. Identify which sections are relevant to the user's question
3. document_deep_read(identifier, section="<heading substring>")
   → returns only that section's text
```

This avoids loading irrelevant content for documents the user only needs one chapter of.

**Sub-agent delegation for very large or multi-document tasks:**

When a task requires reading an entire large document (full MvT, complete Handelingen session, multiple wetsartikelen) and extracting specific information, use a Claude sub-agent (Agent tool, no `subagent_type`). This keeps your main context focused on the user's question:

```
Delegate: "Read the full text of [identifier] using document_deep_read(complete=True).
Extract: [specific information the user needs].
Return: a structured summary with verbatim quotes and section references."
```

Use sub-agent delegation when:
- Document is >100k chars AND you need the full text (not just a section)
- Multiple large documents need parallel processing
- The extraction task is repetitive (e.g., scan all 20 toezeggingen for a keyword)
- You want to preserve your context for the user conversation

The sub-agent shares your MCP tools and returns a single focused result.

### Sample-then-deepen

Default to wide metadata sampling, then deepen on a shortlist. Avoid taking the first 10 results and synthesizing immediately — it produces a biased, shallow answer. Instead:

1. **Wide net (metadata only)**: call the relevant search tool with `max_results=50–100` and ask only for shape: titles, dates, dossier numbers, sources. Use `source_counts` to confirm coverage per source.
2. **Shortlist (5–15 items)**: rank by recency, dossier overlap, type (prefer Commissiedebat / Wetsvoorstel / Beleidsbrief over Procedurevergadering / Schriftelijke vragen unless the question demands them), and source diversity.
3. **Deepen**: for each shortlisted item call `tk_get` / `bwb_get` / `get_dossier_timeline` to pull the full record. Quote evidence from the deep records, not the metadata snippets.
4. **Acknowledge non-coverage**: if a source returned 0 with a non-empty `source_counts` warning, say so. Don't pretend silence is consensus.

### Keyword strategy

- Multi-word keywords are tokenized as AND. `"asiel migratie"` matches docs where both words appear in any field. This is usually right.
- For broad recall, set `keyword_mode="any"` to OR across tokens.
- For precision, prefer the single most discriminating word (`"spreidingswet"` > `"asiel migratie spreidingswet"`).
- TK's OData `$search` is a no-op — never propose it as a workaround. Use `keyword_mode="any"` for wider recall instead.
- KOOP CQL `dt.title all "..."` tokenizes, so multi-word KOOP works without further intervention.
- Rijksoverheid keyword is unreliable without a subject slug. Default workflow: call `list_subjects` first, pick matching slugs, then `rijksoverheid_search(subject=<slug>)`. Free-text `q=` is best-effort only.

## Required output contract

Every workflow should produce this top-level shape:

```json
{
  "workflow_type": "topic_monitor | dossier_tracker | actor_brief | committee_watch | legislative_scan | ministry_narrative | parliamentary_landscape | legislation_lookup | legislative_calendar_watch | law_to_dossier_brief | organization_lookup | exploratory_test",
  "query_params": {},
  "results": [],
  "metadata": {}
}
```

Read [references/output-contract.md](references/output-contract.md) before finalizing any workflow output.

## Workflow selection

Choose the workflow that matches the user goal:

| User need | Workflow | Primary MCP calls |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| "Monitor housing policy in the Netherlands" | Topic monitor | `search_documents` |
| "Track dossier 36228" | Dossier tracker | `get_dossier_timeline`, optional Rijk narrative search |
| "Brief me on Timmermans" | Actor brief | `get_member`, `search_activities(actor=...)`, `search_votes` |
| "Watch committee activity on X" | Committee watch | `list_committees`, `search_activities` |
| "Scan new legislative and vote activity" | Legislative scan | `search_documents`, `search_votes` |
| "What is the ministry saying versus parliament?" | Ministry narrative | `search_documents` or `rijksoverheid_search`, plus TK activity |
| "What does parliament look like right now?" | Parliamentary landscape | `list_factions`, `list_committees`, optionally `search_votes` |
| "Find the Dutch housing law" | Legislation lookup | `bwb_search`, optionally `bwb_get` |
| "What legislation is coming up?" | Legislative calendar watch | `wetgevingskalender_search` |
| "Brief me on dossier 36228 law status" | Law-to-dossier brief | `get_legislative_brief` |
| "Which ministry handles X?" | Organization lookup | `roo_list_organizations`, `roo_get_organization` |
| "Test MCP tool coverage" | Exploratory test | All tools in parallelized sequence |

For the detailed workflow templates, read [references/workflow-templates.md](references/workflow-templates.md).

## Standard workflow

### 1. Confirm the retrieval target

Determine:

- the workflow type
- the query terms or dossier number
- the time window, if any
- the maximum result depth needed

If the request is ambiguous, narrow the retrieval target before calling tools.

### 2. Read from the MCP

Use the smallest MCP surface that answers the question:

- use unified tools for monitoring and briefing flows
- use source-specific tools when you need query power the unified layer lacks (OData filters, CQL queries, specific entity sets) — see [references/tool-reference.md](references/tool-reference.md) for the escalation path
- for discovery, prefer the MCP resources, README, and MCP introspection before external `tool_search`
- resolve Rijksoverheid `subject` and `ministry` filters through `list_subjects` / `list_ministries` first; use canonical slugs where the upstream endpoint expects path segments, and avoid unsupported combined `news` filters such as `subject + ministry` unless the MCP explicitly supports them
- parallelize independent tool calls aggressively — reference lookups (list_*) are always independent, search tools are independent of each other. See parallelization groups in the tool reference
- keep the tool list in `metadata.tool_calls`
- for exploratory MCP testing (template 8), use bounded parameters; for production research, request enough data for comprehensive coverage

### 3. Shape the response

Transform the MCP output into the stable workflow contract:

- `workflow_type`: one of the supported workflow ids
- `query_params`: the exact effective parameters used
- `results`: workflow-specific result objects
- `metadata`: counts, warnings, provenance, assumptions, and optional brief synthesis

### 4. State uncertainty explicitly

Use `metadata` for:

- `warnings`
- `tool_calls`
- `source_counts`
- `assumptions`
- `linkage_notes`

Examples:

- "Rijksoverheid narrative context is keyword-based and not deterministically linked to the dossier."
- "Vote activity is faction-level proxy context when member-level vote attribution is unavailable from the MCP."

## Workflow-specific guidance

### Topic monitor

Goal: chronological document retrieval across Dutch public-affairs sources.

**Step 1 — Wide net**: call with `max_results=50` to sample shape before deepening.

```
search_documents(keyword="spreidingswet", max_results=50)
```

Check `source_counts` in the response: if a source shows `null` or a warning like `"0 results for keyword='spreidingswet' — verify spelling..."`, that source didn't contribute. Do not interpret absence of results as absence of policy signal — note it explicitly.

**Step 2 — Shortlist**: pick 5–15 items by recency + type. Prefer Commissiedebat, Wetsvoorstel, Beleidsbrief. Deprioritize Procedurevergadering and Schriftelijke vragen unless the question is procedural.

**Step 3 — Deep dive**: call `tk_get` on shortlisted TK IDs to pull full records:

```
tk_get(entity="Document", entity_id="<id from results>")
```

Quote from full records, not from the metadata snippet in the search results.

Notes on keyword behavior:

- Multi-word keywords are tokenized — every word must appear (in any field, in any order). `"asiel migratie"` matches "Beleidsbrief Asiel en Migratie" and "Migratie en asielketen".
- For broader recall use `keyword_mode="any"` to OR across tokens.
- For precision, prefer the single most discriminating word (`"spreidingswet"` over `"asiel migratie spreidingswet"`).
- The response includes `source_counts` (per-source totals) and `total_count` (max across sources, NOT a sum). When a source returns 0 with a keyword query, a `warnings[]` entry surfaces the diagnostic — read it.

Shape:

- flat `results[]` with source labels, dates, types, dossier fields, URLs
- `source_counts` — per-source `total_count` map
- `total_count` — max across sources (use `source_counts` for source-level coverage)
- optional `metadata.synthesis` with 2-4 high-signal observations

### Dossier tracker

Goal: procedural chronology for a known dossier.

Use:

- `get_dossier_timeline(dossier_number=...)`
- optionally a Rijk narrative retrieval keyed off dossier title or user topic

Shape:

- ordered `results[]` timeline with stage labels
- `metadata.dossier`
- `metadata.stage_counts`
- `metadata.narrative_context`

Do not merge narrative context into the canonical timeline. Keep it separate in `metadata`.

### Dossier sub-number lookups

- KOOP sub-document references like `36871-63` (motie 63 within dossier 36871) are addressable via `koop_search(query='w.dossiernummer==36871 AND w.dossierondernummer==63')`.
- TK's preferred path for a single sub-document: `tk_search(Document, $filter="HoofdDossier eq 36871 and Volgnummer eq 63")` or by `Identificatie eq 'kst-36871-63'`.
- If the sub-document is a motie and you know the actor, prefer `search_activities(actor=..., dossier_number=36871)` and resolve the related document from the activity's DocumentActor expansion — this often surfaces the correct sub-document with its vote outcome attached.

### Cross-chamber tracking

- TK is one chamber. Once a wetsvoorstel passes "Eindstemming" in TK, it moves to Eerste Kamer (EK), which this MCP does **not** cover today.
- Use `get_dossier_chamber_status` to determine whether a dossier is still in TK, has moved to EK, or is concluded. When it's in EK, surface the EK URL hint and label the brief accordingly — do not claim the dossier is "stalled" just because TK activity stopped.
- Former MPs (`Functie: "Oud Kamerlid"`) are a parallel signal of historical context; combine with chamber status when narrating a dossier's lifecycle.

### Actor brief

Goal: structured actor profile with surrounding parliamentary context.

Use:

- `get_member(query=...)`
- if a single match is returned: `search_activities(actor=<member name>)`
- if a faction is available: `search_votes(faction=<member faction>)` as proxy vote context

Shape:

- if ambiguous: return multiple candidates in `results[]` and mark `metadata.ambiguity=true`
- if resolved: return one brief object containing `member`, `recent_activities`, `vote_context`, and derived `committee_signals`

When member-level votes are not directly available, label the vote section as faction proxy context.

**Inactive member handling**: Check `metadata.Functie` in the `get_member` response. If it reads `"Oud Kamerlid"` (former MP):

- The member is no longer active — note this prominently in the brief
- `faction` will likely be `null` (dissolved or departed). Check `metadata.Fractielabel` for the last known faction, and note it as historical context
- `search_activities` will return only historical activity — this is still valuable, label it accordingly
- For vote context, skip `search_votes` by faction (no current faction to proxy). Instead, note that vote context is unavailable for former members
- If the member's former faction still exists in `list_factions`, you may optionally include faction vote context labeled as "former faction activity — not attributable to this member"
- If the former faction has dissolved (not in `list_factions`), note this as a finding — it signals a political restructuring event worth mentioning in the brief

### Committee watch

Goal: surface what a specific TK committee is actually doing — recent debates, decisions, and procedural signals.

Use:

- `list_committees` to resolve the committee name and abbreviation (case-sensitive, contains-match works on `Voortouwnaam`/`Voortouwafkorting`)
- `search_activities(committee=<NaamNL>, time_window="past")` for recent positions and debates
- `search_activities(committee=<NaamNL>, time_window="future")` for the upcoming calendar
- `search_documents(keyword=<topic>)` to pair the calendar with substantive committee documents

`time_window` semantics:

| Value | When to use | Behavior |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `"past"` (default) | "What has the committee decided / discussed?" | Clamps `Datum <= today` and sorts latest-first |
| `"future"` | "What is on the calendar?" | Clamps `Datum >= today` and sorts nearest-first |
| `"all"` | Diagnostic only | No clamp; latest-first (may surface far-future Procedurevergaderingen above recent debates — usually noisy, prefer `"past"`/`"future"`) |

Always present the past view AND the calendar view as two separate sections. A single mixed list confuses the reader because procedural meetings (Procedurevergadering) dominate by volume but are administrative, while Commissiedebat / Wetgevingsoverleg are the substantive activities worth leading with.

If the committee has no past activity in the last 6 months, widen `date_from` to 12 months — committees go quiet between cycles.

### Legislation lookup

Goal: find a Dutch law by title or BWB identifier and retrieve version metadata.

Use:

- `bwb_search(title=..., regelingsoort=..., ...)` for search
- `bwb_get(identifier=...)` for version retrieval

Shape:

- `results[]` with BWB records including identifier, title, type, geldigheid dates, URLs
- `metadata.version_count` when multiple toestanden exist

BWB uses zoekservice.overheid.nl (SRU 1.2). Title search uses `overheidbwb.titel all "..."` (keyword matching). Prefer exact identifiers when you already have a canonical BWB id. Returns rich metadata including rechtsgebied, geldigheidsperiode dates, and authority.

### Legislative calendar watch

Goal: monitor upcoming legislation in the Dutch legislative pipeline.

Use:

- `wetgevingskalender_search(keyword=..., wgk_type=..., ministry=..., phase=...)`

WGK type values are case-sensitive: `Wet`, `Amvb`, `Regeling`.
Phase values: `Voorbereiding`, `Raad van State`, `Tweede Kamer`, `Eerste Kamer`, `Bekendmaking`.

Shape:

- `results[]` with planning items including type, ministry, phase, entry_into_force, and identifiers
- `metadata.type_counts`
- `metadata.phase_counts`
- `metadata.ministry_counts`

### Law-to-dossier brief

Goal: produce a combined brief for a dossier or BWB identifier.

Use:

- `get_legislative_brief(dossier_number=..., bwb_identifier=...)`

Shape:

- `results` with `law` (BWB versions), `publications` (KOOP kamerstukken)
- `metadata.law_count`, `metadata.publication_count`

### Organization lookup

Goal: resolve Dutch government organization names to canonical identifiers.

Use:

- `roo_list_organizations(org_type="Ministerie")` for listing
- `roo_get_organization(uri=...)` for detail including identification codes

Results use TOOI URIs as canonical identifiers. Prefer feeding the full URI returned by `roo_list_organizations` into `roo_get_organization`. This is useful for normalizing ministry names from BWB/WGK/Rijksoverheid outputs.

## Payload hygiene

- `get_dossier_timeline` defaults to `verbose=False` — the metadata blobs are intentionally stripped. Re-call with `verbose=True` ONLY for a specific event ID after shortlisting.
- Never call `max_results=200` blindly. Use 50–100 for sampling, then narrow.
- For dossiers older than 5 years, restrict `date_from` to compress the timeline.
- All unified search tools (`search_documents`, `search_activities`, `search_votes`, `search_legislation`) strip `metadata` by default (`compact=True`). Pass `compact=False` only when you need the raw upstream row for a specific record.

## Validation

A validation harness is bundled at `skills/nl-gov-data/scripts/validate_workflows.py` for development use. Note: the script was written for a local stdio server and will need adaptation to work against the hosted endpoint. Use it as a reference for workflow shapes rather than running it directly.
